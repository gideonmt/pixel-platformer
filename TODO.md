   - [ ] Implement input handling for the start menu.
       - Detect mouse clicks or keyboard inputs to navigate and select menu options.

**Game Logic:**

   - [ ] Design the game world.
       - Sketch the level layout, platform positions, and character appearance.
   - [ ] Implement player character movement (WASD) and jumping (Space key).
       - Create functions to update player position and handle input.
   - [ ] Implement physics for character movement and jumping.
       - Include gravity and collision handling.
   - [ ] Define collision detection logic.
       - Check for collisions between the player character and platforms/obstacles.
   - [ ] Implement win/lose conditions and game-over screens.
       - Define conditions for winning or losing, and create game-over screens.

**Game Resource Management:**

   - [ ] Optimize resource loading to reduce memory usage.
       - Load resources once and reuse them when needed.
   - [ ] Use resource pooling for frequently used assets.
       - Reuse resources like fonts and textures to minimize memory allocation.
   - [ ] Unload and release resources that are no longer in use.
       - Implement a system to release unused resources.
   - [ ] Create a resource management system.
       - Build a resource manager to handle textures, fonts, and sounds efficiently.

**Game States:**

   - [ ] Implement a game state management system.
       - Create a state machine to manage transitions between menus and gameplay.
   - [ ] Create functions to switch between different game states.
       - Define functions for transitioning from menu to gameplay, and vice versa.

**User Interface:**

   - [ ] Design and implement user interface elements.
       - Create UI elements like score displays and message boxes.
   - [ ] Implement UI interactions and transitions.
       - Design functions for displaying scores and handling transitions between screens.
   - [ ] Create an options menu for settings.
       - Build a menu for adjusting settings like sound and controls.

**Audio:**

   - [ ] Add background music and sound effects.
   - [ ] Implement audio resource management.
       - Create a system to load, play, and unload audio resources.
       - Make music play on repeat/shuffle.
       - Make sound effects.
   - [ ] Create functions to play, pause, and stop audio.
       - Implement functions to control audio playback.

**Optimization:**

   - [ ] Profile and optimize rendering.
       - Use efficient rendering techniques, minimize draw calls, and batch rendering where possible.
   - [ ] Implement memory management strategies.
       - Release resources, use smart pointers where applicable, and monitor memory usage.
   - [ ] Minimize resource loading during gameplay.
       - Load textures, fonts, and sounds before the game starts, and reuse them as much as possible.
   - [ ] Implement efficient collision detection.
       - Optimize collision checks between game objects and platforms or obstacles.
   - [ ] Profile and optimize physics calculations.
       - Ensure that physics calculations are efficient, especially for character movement and jumping.
